Useless asf but i had fun making it.

## Usage

1. Start the Go server on your computer
2. Launch the mobile app on your device
3. Tap "Connect" to establish a WebSocket connection
4. Use the accelerometer to move the mouse by tilting your device
5. Use the bottom buttons for left, right, and double clicks
6. Access settings by tapping the gear icon to adjust sensitivity and other options

## Troubleshooting

- If the connection fails, make sure:

  - The server URL is correct (including your computer's IP address)
  - Your device and computer are on the same network
  - No firewall is blocking the connection
